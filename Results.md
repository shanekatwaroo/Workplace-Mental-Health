- From this query, we can see that between all genders, there is a common consensus that mental health has some sort of an impact on workplace activities. Despite
the idea that we should keep a separation between what goes on at home and our work, it is difficult to do this when our mental health is affected. 



## KPI 2: Age distribution on which mental health affects workplace activities.

- From this query, we can see that the most common age range that feels that mental health affects the workplace often are people in their early 30's. Although
some may think that younger people face more mental health problems, the data showed that younger workers tend to believe that their mental health does not have 
an adverse affect on their workplace activities. This is the same for people who are older than 40. 



## KPI 3: Which states provide the most mental health benefits?

- This query shows that the state with the most mental health benefits is California. Something interesting that I noted during this analysis is that California
had more workers saying that their workplace has benefits compared to all countries (excluding the U.S.) in the dataset combined.
