# Workplace MentalHealth

## Introduction
I recently read an article discussing the adverse effects of mental health in the workplace, specifically for tech companies. Because of this, I decided to find a dataset that elaborates on the idea of employees not being able to perform up to par in the workplace due to these mental health problems. 

## Dataset
The dataset I used is titled: Mental Health in Tech Survey. It was created by Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD, and it includes a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. There are many columns in the dataset, so I reccommend you check out the link to the kaggle source here: https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey

## Process
For this project, I decided to extract the dataset using python. I then cleaned the dataset with the pandas dataframe in python. After that, I connected to a mySQL server from python and answered a few KPI's with the data.
